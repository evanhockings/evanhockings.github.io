  Talk slides for 'Improving error suppression with noise-aware decoding'

---

I recently gave a talk to my group on my paper 'Improving error suppression with noise-aware decoding' [arXiv:2502.21044](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21044).
As I had the full hour for the talk, I included an idiosyncratic introduction to stabiliser quantum error correction through the lens of symplectic vector spaces.
It was a good excuse to learn how to use Beamer!
